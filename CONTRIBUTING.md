## Contributing

**General Rules**

- As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown and code.
- Don't forget to run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before submitting pull requests.
- Make sure that **100%** of your code is covered by tests.

**Contributing New Algorithms**

- Make your pull requests to be **specific** and **focused**. Instead of 
contributing "several sorting algorithms" all at once contribute them all 
one by one separately (i.e. one pull request for "Quick Sort", another one
for "Heap Sort" and so on).
- Provide **README.md** for each of the algorithms **with explanations** of
the algorithm and **with links** to further readings.
- Describe what you do in code using **comments**.
